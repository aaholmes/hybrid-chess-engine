# Testing Guide for Caissawary

~830 tests (660 Rust + 175 Python) covering the engine, search, and training pipeline.

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo test                                        # Fast Rust tests (~50s, ~660 tests)
cargo test --features slow-tests                  # Full suite including perft (~200s)
cd python && python -m pytest test_*.py -v        # Python pipeline tests (~175 tests)
./scripts/test.sh                                 # Scripted run (unit → integration → property)
```

## Rust Test Categories

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

Focus on individual components in isolation:
- **Board:** FEN parsing, state representation, castling rights
- **Move Generation:** Validity of moves, pseudo-legal vs legal generation
- **Node:** MCTS node value logic, terminal state handling
- **Selection:** UCB/PUCT calculations, tactical priority ordering
- **Make Move:** Incremental Zobrist hashing, castling updates
- **SEE:** Static exchange evaluation
- **Quiescence:** `forced_material_balance()`, material-only Q-search
- **Training Data:** Binary serialization, sample extraction

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)

Test the interaction between subsystems:
- **Mate Search:** Verifies the engine finds mates in complex positions
- **Tactical Priority:** Ensures tactical moves (captures, checks) are prioritized
- **Neural Integration:** Tests the flow between the search tree and (mocked) inference server
- **KOTH:** King of the Hill win detection and geometric pruning

### Property Tests (`tests/property/`)

Uses `proptest` to generate random inputs and verify invariants:
- **Legal Moves:** Random positions ensure `generate_legal_moves` never produces illegal states
- **Value Domains:** Verifies evaluations stay within valid bounds

### Perft Tests (`tests/perft_tests.rs`)

Performance and correctness tests for move generation (gated behind `--features slow-tests`). Walk the game tree to a fixed depth and compare leaf counts against known correct values.

## Python Tests
